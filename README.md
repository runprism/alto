# :wave: Welcome to Nomad!
Nomad is the easiest way to run any code (functions, scripts, jupyter notebooks, or entire projects) on any cloud environment!

## Getting Started

Prism can be installed via ```pip```. Prism requires Python >= 3.7.

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install nomad-dev
```

## Cloud environments
Nomad currently supports the following cloud environments (which we call "Agents"):
- **ec2**


## Product Roadmap

We're always looking to improve our product. Here's what we're working on at the moment:

- **Additional Agents**: GCP Virtual Machines, EMR clusters, Databricks clusters, and more!
- **Managed service**: Managed platform to easily view, manage, and schedule your different cloud deployments

Let us know if you'd like to see another feature!
